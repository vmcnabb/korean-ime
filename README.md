* Korean IME Chrome Extension

** Introduction
The primary purpose of the project is to allow people to type Hanguel in Chrome when the OS does not have a Korean IME installed.

It is primarily useful for people that want to type Korean on a computer where they don't have rights to install the Microsoft IME.
