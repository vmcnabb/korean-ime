# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
Having opinions is fine.

Insulting the code is fine as long as you include how the code could be better. Before insulting, consider that YOU could be the one that is wrong. Better yet, only do the second part (saying how the code could be better) and leave out the unnecessary insult.

Insulting the writer of said code is not OK.

Insulting anyone for any belief (political or otherwise) or for who/what they are/choose to be is not OK. A coding project isn't really the forum for those kinds of discussions anyway.

Not everyone is good at using "welcoming and inclusive language". That's a skill that's hard to attain, so the Github standard Covenent is not welcoming as it excludes those who may be socially underskilled. Before feeling insulted by a statement, please consider that the author may just lack these kinds of skills and try to be forgiving.
